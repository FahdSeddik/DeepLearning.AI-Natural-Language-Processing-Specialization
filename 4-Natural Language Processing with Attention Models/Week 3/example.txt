I've got a 500gb internal drive and a 240gb SSD.
When trying to restore using disk utility i'm given the error "Not enough space on disk ____ to restore"
But I shouldn't have to do that!!!
Any ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above?
Use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in "file mode" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).
I've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..
Thanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.

How many backlinks per day for new site?

1) for a newly created site, what's the max # backlinks per day I should do to be safe?
2) how long do I have to let my site age before I can start making more blinks?
I did about 6000 forum profiles every 24 hours for 10 days for one of my sites which had a brand new domain.
There is three backlinks for every of these forum profile so thats 18 000 backlinks every 24 hours and nothing happened in terms of being penalized or sandboxed. This is now maybe 3 months ago and the site is ranking on first page for a lot of my targeted keywords.
build more you can in starting but do manual submission and not spammy type means manual + relevant to the post.. then after 1 month you can make a big blast..
Wow, dude, you built 18k backlinks a day on a brand new site? How quickly did you rank up? What kind of competition/searches did those keywords have?
