# Twitter Samples


These samples of Tweets (or 'status updates') were collected from the Twitter Streaming APIs (see [API Documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation), [Streaming Overview](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview)). Each file consists of line-separated JSON-formatted tweets, i.e. one Tweet per line. For a detailed description of the JSON fields in a Tweet, see [Tweets: Field Guide](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets).

Any use of this data is subject to the [Twitter Developer Agreement and
Developer Policy](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy).
